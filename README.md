# Plan It Perfect - Event Management System

## Project Overview
**Plan It Perfect** is a Java-based event management system designed to streamline the process of hosting and participating in events. This project provides a backend solution where users can manage their accounts, view upcoming events, and book slots for the events of their choice. Event organizers can create and manage their events, while participants can book a slot to attend the event. Each user can only book a slot for each event but can book multiple seats within the event's available capacity. The system allows users to update their profiles, ensuring that their information is always current. Additionally, users can view their booking history to keep track of the events they have registered for and the details of their bookings.

## Features
- **User Registration & Login**: Allows users to create an account and log in securely to access the system. Once logged in, users can interact with the event functionalities.
- **Event Management**: Event organizers can create and manage events. These events can be viewed by all registered users.
- **Slot Booking**: Users can book a slot for an event, provided there are available slots. Each user can only book a slot for an event once but can book any number of seats for that event, as long as the booking doesn't exceed the event's capacity.
- **Capacity Management**: The system ensures that users can only book slots within the available capacity for each event. Once an event reaches full capacity, no further bookings can be made.
